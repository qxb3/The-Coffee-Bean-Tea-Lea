# The Different Types Of Coffee: From Healthies To Least Healthy

### Health Benifits Of Coffee

To find the healthiest type of coffee, consider the coffee beans, preparation techniques, and add-ons (like milk and sugar) in each cup.

### The Healthies Cup Of Coffee Is Not The Same For Everyone

Determining the healthiest cup of coffee for you depends on your health goals. If you’re trying to lose weight, you should opt for low-calorie or calorie-free beverages.

If you’re sensitive to caffeine or have anxiety or a heart condition, you might need to switch to decaf coffee. (Decaf also contains antioxidants and in many studies shows similar health benefits as full-strength coffee.) If you have diabetes, you’ll want to reduce the amount of sugar you add to your brew.

If you’re trying to fight disease with an anti-inflammatory diet, the healthiest cup might include soothing cinnamon or turmeric.

How your body processes caffeine makes a difference in the best coffee for you. “Individuals metabolize caffeine differently,” says Chicago-based registered dietitian Vicki Shanta Rentelny.
The more you know about your body’s needs, the more apt you are to choose the brew that’s best for you.

### What Makes Coffee More Or Else Healthy?

Many factors affect the healthfulness of your coffee. Hélène Bertrand, MD, a physician and scientific researcher based in Vancouver, Canada, names caffeine among coffee’s biggest health concerns.

Other things that play a role in coffee’s health quality include:
- Added sweeteners
- Added milk or cream
- Antioxidant content (coffee’s flavonoids and polyphenols can reduce oxidative stress, which plays a role in disease development)
- Brewing method (such as French press, drip-brewed, and espresso machine)

How healthy a cup of coffee is doesn’t just depend on whether you’re drinking a caramel macchiato versus espresso. “The effects of coffee vary widely based on the type of bean, the brand of coffee, the roast, and the brewing method,” says Shanta Rentelny.
Regardless of how you prefer and prepare your coffee, Shanta Retelny says there’s one key consideration: the amount you consume. “It’s best to be moderate with any coffee beverage,” she says.

### The Healthiest Cup Of Coffee

“To get the biggest nutritional bang for your coffee buck, I recommend keeping coffee simple by adding less to your brew,” says Shanta Retelny. She also says it’s best to rotate your coffee beans so that you drink a variety of roasts.

There is no research-backed conclusion as to which kind of coffee is the healthiest. However, it’s possible to narrow down your options by eliminating sweetened lattes, very dark roasts (because of the low antioxidant content), very light roasts (because of the high caffeine content), and unfiltered coffee.

In the end, an unsweetened cup of medium-roast black coffee is probably the best.

### The Worst For Your Health

Our health experts agree that adding loads of sweeteners to your coffee or overindulging in caffeinated beverages is bad for your health.

Still, there is no single java that is objectively the worst for your health. Benefits and risks depend on moderation.

A Starbucks grande (medium) white chocolate mocha clocks in at 430 calories, 16 grams of fat, and 54 grams of carbohydrates. The amount of sugar and fat is concerning.
On the other end of the spectrum, drinking a full carafe of blonde roast coffee brewed in a French press will give you more caffeine and diterpenes than you really need, downsides even if you don’t add cream or sugar.

Still, enjoying your cup of coffee—whether it’s sweetened, dark roast, or any type that gives  you pleasure—is important too.

“It’s the total diet that counts,” says Shanta Retelny, “not one food or beverage.”

### Tips To Make Your Coffee Habit Healthier

- Limit your  intake.
- Avoid Sweeteners
- Drink water, too.
- Use spices for flavor.
