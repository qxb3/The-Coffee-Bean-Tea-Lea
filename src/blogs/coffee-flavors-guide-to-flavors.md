# Coffee Flavors: Guide To Flavors

I’m sure we can all agree with David Lynch when he said that “even bad coffee is better than no coffee at all.”

Coffee is more than a beverage, it's an experience that transcends the ritual of the morning routine. It's the aroma that awakens the soul, the warmth that comforts, and the flavors that linger long after the last sip. It's a conversation starter, a companion in solitude, and a bridge that connects us to distant lands and the hands that cultivated the beans.

So, join us in this odyssey of taste, where each cup is an invitation to explore, discover, and savor the nuances that make coffee an extraordinary journey of the senses. Learning about coffee flavors can help us refine our tastes and shop for coffee that is better suited to our particular tastes.

# What are flavors notes?

A flavor note is a small part of a coffee’s flavor that can easily be singled out. Flavor is incredibly complex, so describing it as a whole, with just one word, just can’t ever do it justice. Instead, we use flavor notes in addition to aroma.

# Utilizing A Coffee Flavor Wheel

For those who are interested in flavor, here is a very helpful tool. It is a “flavor wheel”, which shows different flavors, and displays the intensity of flavor and aroma. It is immensely helpful when trying to find the words for the flavors we find in our coffee.

If you take a look at the flavor wheel, you’ll notice it goes from the most general flavors to more specific ones; that’s how you should always approach it. And that’s how we’ll do it here! Each general flavor can derive in many different flavor notes.

**For example**: **fruity** → **dried** **fruit** → **raisin**.

**The five most important ones in coffee are bitter, sweet, floral, fruity, and roasted.**

- Bitter

Probably the one flavor that most people think of when they think of coffee. Why is coffee bitter?— because of caffeine!

However, bitterness is an asset in all foods. A little bit of bitterness brings balance and can be enjoyed—as long as it’s not overpowering.

You won’t find bitter in the flavor wheel, except at the very end of “other”. But in coffee, bitterness has to be one of the very first flavors you look for: how bitter is it? Does it compliment the drink, or does it overpower other flavor notes?

- Sweet

Sweet flavors are some of the most appreciated in general culture. Sweet is often a synonym of good-tasting, so anything sweet holds great value in food and drink—coffee is no exception. Coffee beans have sugar in them, which are caramelized when roasted.

The main subcategory of sweet flavors we encounter in coffee is brown sugar; “A rich, full, round, sweet aromatic impression characterized by some degree of darkness.”

- Floral

Floral is a flavor note that has as much importance in flavor as it does in the aroma. And, in fact, aroma plays a big part in flavor.

Some say that it is even more important than the flavor itself. Professional coffee tasters have this slurping technique which, although a little grotesque to witness, delivers coffee to the back of the throat, where it can be perceived by our nose better.

- Fruity

As we mentioned before, coffee beans are actually seeds. These seeds are inside the coffee cherry. The coffee cherry isn’t a big fruit (and it’s mostly skin, actually) and has a very mild taste that reminds you of apricot, a common flavor note in coffee.
So it follows that coffee, depending on the variety, will have a fruity flavor. Each different variety, blend, and roast will bring out different types of fruitiness: **Dried Fruit, Tropical Fruit, Cherries, Berries**

- Roasted

Coffee is actually a roasted seed. There is one legend that attributes the discovery of coffee to the actual act of roasting it:

The story goes that one goat herder in Ethiopia had accidentally discovered that eating the coffee fruit would bestow his energy. This is the most common “origin story” for coffee. But it’s missing the most important part.

As it stands, that story only tells of caffeine, actually. And while caffeine is an important part of coffee, we are here for the flavor above all. So how was coffee, as we drink it now, discovered?
That same pastor brought the fruit to the local priest. The priest listened to his words and was immediately certain that it was a bad thing. So, he took the half-eaten fruit and cast it into the fire.

A few minutes went by, and as the seeds started to cook, the room was filled with that hypnotic aroma of freshly roasted coffee. The priest had a miraculous change of mind, and the word started spreading about this roasted seed.

It is the roasty flavor and aroma that started it all. There are different qualities when it comes to roastiness: **Cereal(Roasted/toasted), Roasty**
